		<h2 style='padding-top:1rem;'>Making a full 3d city BY HAND takes a lot of time</h2>
		<div class='texte_lisible'>
			<p>
				Creating a city is hard. </p>
			<p>
				Traditionally it must be constructed by hand in a 3d application by an artist. While this approach gives the artist full control, it requires
				skill and a LOT of time to complete an entire city. Don't even mention if later you want to change its layout. </p>
			<p>
				One can use tricks, shortcuts, and other Blender features such as particles, or random mesh extrusions to accelerate the work, it remains
				tedious nonetheless. And the results aren't always as great as our vision. Simply because there is a lot to do, and Blender is 'only' a generic
				3d application, not a specialized city builder. </p>
			<p>
				But with SceneCity, you add specific city building capabilities to Blender! </p>

		<h2>Flexible node-based workflow <span style="font-size: medium">(in version 1)</span></h2>
		<img style='max-width:100%;' src='../static/store/img/scenecity/node_workflow.jpg'/>
		<div class='texte_lisible'>
			<p>Plug pieces of functionality together to reach your desired goals. You describe your cities conceptually with nodes within graphs, and those can
				be as small or as large as you want.</p>
			<p>Some nodes place buildings, others create road networks, and others generate procedural facade textures. More will be added giving you even more
				possibilities with every new version.</p>

		<h2>SceneCity eases the workflow drastically!</h2>
		<img style='max-width:100%;' src='../static/store/img/scenecity/log37.jpg'/>
		<div class='texte_lisible'>
			<p>
				Time is precious. You cannot place each and every piece of a city by hand, there are hundreds of them, if not thousands. Instead let SceneCity
				do the boring work for you (like instancing and positioning objects), while you keep the fun creative part (like modeling and animating). </p>
			<p>
				Describe the city you want in SceneCity using parameters, such as city size, what buildings to use, where to place them etc... the whole city is
				then created in a matter of seconds or few minutes, ready for you to play with, like adding cars, pedestrians, changing whatever you want, and
				rendering still images or animations. </p>
			<p>
				Changing something is as easy as changing a parameter value, then recreating the city. Thanks to Blender, and depending on which instantiation
				method you choose, you can even modify a city without recreating it. Modifying the model of a building automatically changes all instances of
				that building everywhere it appears in the city. </p>

				SceneCity comes batteries included: props, roads and buildings. Load them in a click, and generate a city. It's that simple. Once included in

				That's why you're not limited to the included libraries for your cities. You can mix, or use your own exclusively very easily. Tell SceneCity to

				Export entire cities to Unity for realtime rendering and navigation. First you must have all your assets already in Unity: models, materials,
				prefabs for buildings, roads, and props (the included assets are pre-exported in a Unity package, you just have to import it into your Unity
				projects). </p>
			<p>
				Then generate your city from Blender, and export it using the specific node for it. The output is a text file describing your city. From Unity
				open the SceneCity loader window, load the exported file, set all corresponding assets, and with the click of a button, your entire city is
				re-created in Unity, down to every prop object. </p>
			<p>
				This method is a lot more efficient than exporting the entire city directly with FBX because you keep the control on your prefabs for the
				buildings, roads and props. Use any prefab and modify them anytime after the city is imported. That includes complex objects with scripts,
				objects hierarchies, nested prefabs, physics setups, sound sources, LOD, and all other Unity prefab features. </p>
